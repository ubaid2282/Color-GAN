Image colorization is a process that involves transforming grayscale images into their colored counterparts. It has significant applications in the restoration of old photographs, film enhancement, medical imaging, and artistic design. Colorization requires understanding both the content and context of the image, which makes it a challenging task for machine learning models. While traditional techniques relied heavily on manual intervention or rule-based algorithms, recent advancements in deep learning, especially in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promising results in automating this process. GANs, first introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, consist of two competing networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator attempts to produce realistic data samples, while the discriminator evaluates them against real data, thereby guiding the generator to improve. In this project, we develop a GAN that learns to predict color from grayscale images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our goal is not only to build a functioning model but also to demonstrate its real-world usability by integrating it into a Flask-based web application. This ensures that the model is accessible and user-friendly, allowing anyone to upload a grayscale image and receive a colorized version. The system is designed to work efficiently in a CPU-only environment, making it suitable for deployment on platforms with limited resources like Google Colab free tier.
